This file contains a list of popular algorithms that are used to solve and/or optimize the solutions for problems.

- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
- Boyer-Moore 
- Dijkstra
- Prim's algorithm
- Kruskal algorithm
- Bellman-Ford algorithm
- Fast Fourier Transform
- Binary search (along with the other search algorithms)
- mergeSort, quickSort, and the other sort algorithms
- Divide and conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- recursion (not an algorithm, but important to know, along with advanded recursive techniques: tail-recursion, Continutation Passing style, etc.)


Review class notes, we talked a lot about these.
