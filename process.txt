The process of solving a problem

It's important to think about the problem first before starting to write code.

=> Think of the corner cases; the solution you'll write might not need any extra code to deal with all of them. But it's important to keep them in mind.

=> Write the general solution; this is the solution that will work with most cases. How does it handle corner cases?

=> Add the code that needs to handle corner cases; your solution might already take care of this, so this step isn't always necessary.

=> during interviews, your time is limited, don't try to come up with the optimal solution in one shot. First just have a working solution, and then if you have time
    optimize it.

=> On VSCode, don't use the debugger. Most times you won't have access to a debugger during an interview.
