The process of solving a problem

It's important to think about the problem first before starting to write code.

=>One bad habit I have is I rush the code and spam submit to see if it passes. This is bad, first think about your code, write down on paper your plans, then 
    start coding. This shows that your patient and that your solutions are well thought through. And this is your attitude towards coding.

=> Don't make assumptions about code unless it is given to you in the problem. ask the interviewer

=> Think of the corner cases; the solution you'll write might not need any extra code to deal with all of them. But it's important to keep them in mind.

=> Write the general solution; this is the solution that will work with most cases. How does it handle corner cases?

=> Add the code that needs to handle corner cases; your solution might already take care of this, so this step isn't always necessary.

=> during interviews, your time is limited, don't try to come up with the optimal solution in one shot. First just have a working solution, and then if you have time
    optimize it.

=> On VSCode, don't use the debugger. Most times you won't have access to a debugger during an interview.
