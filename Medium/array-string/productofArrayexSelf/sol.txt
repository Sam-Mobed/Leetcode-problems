soltuion:
you could either use O(n) memory complexity, by havign two arrays: prefix and postfix. Or you could do the solution in O(1)
memory complexity by doing everything inside of the same array.

if you decide to use the prefix and postfix arrays:
the prefix array: for each index i, the value is the product of all the elements from 0 to i-1
the postfix array: for each index i, the value is the product of all the element from i+1 to the end of the array.
finally, we iterate through the result array, and take the the values at i inside the prefix and postfix arrays and multiply them.
this technique, we use O(n) extra space, and we do O(n) three times.

without the two arrays:
apply the same logic but store everything inside the same array
