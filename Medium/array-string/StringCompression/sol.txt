pretty disgusting question. i solved it with two pointers. one traverses the array while
arr[ptr1]==arr[ptr2] and ptr2<len(arr).
once the two characters dont match, we check ptr2-ptr1. and if it is greater than 1,
every indice between ptr1+1 and ptr2 will be arr[i]='*'
and we calculate the diff between ptr1 and ptr2, and for each digit in str(diff)
we write it in the space between ptr1 and ptr2.
if there are any remaining starts between the two pointers, we pop them, and continue with the problem

unnecessarily convoluted, and it didnt pass all test cases.


Turns out the solution is convoluted too, you have no choice but to use two pointers.
you use two pointers, iterate through the array, pop all the repeating chars, add the count as separate
digits.
