similar to the first part, you start with two pointers, left and right.
left=0
right=1

every time the right pointer is pointing to a value that is smaller than the one on the left, we move the left pointer to that position.
on the other hand, if the value at the right pointer is indeed larger than the one on the left, we add the profit gained to the total profit, and we
move left pointer to the position of right pointer, and we increment right pointer.

the logic is so simple im surprised it worked.
