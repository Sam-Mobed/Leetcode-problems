In C, characters can be treated like integers.
In python, we can do the same to some extent.
character to int conversion: by using the built in ord() function

It was a nice try, but words with different characters can sum up to the same thing.
Instead I used the sorted version of each word as the keys, and the values held lists of the original words.
Performance was ok
