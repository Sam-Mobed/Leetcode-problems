This was actually considered hard, but it was put inside medium.

Multiple issues with this one, how do you choose between creating a sequence or adding to an existing one? how do you merge sequences?
It can be done if you sort the array, or go through the dict multiple time, but all of these solutions are way past O(n) time complexity.

Solution:

Think of it like this, every element that is the head of a sequence is obviously the smallest in that sequence. which means that that element-1 doesn't exist
in the input, or else it would be the head of that sequence.
if element-1 does not exist, then element is the head of the set. if you found a head, look for element+1, if it exists, keep going until element+n doesn't exist.

NOTE: for this sort of problem, it's important to visualize/write it down on paper. make a line representing natural numbers, and add the sequences to it.
and notice how head of sequences don't have a left element, etc.

my thoughts(don't work, you have to do it backwards.):
so the first step is to turn the input list into a set. and then iterate through the set.
look at the first element: is there element-1 in the rest of the set? if so, is there element-2? and keep going until there isn't element-n.
and everytime you're looking, increment a counter.
