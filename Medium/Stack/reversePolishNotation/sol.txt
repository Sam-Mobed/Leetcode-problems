I solved it myself, fairly intuitive, you just have to notice that you have to append the result back into the stack and use it later.

the only issue was with the division. // the round division didn't work here. it always rounded down, but if the number was negative, it would 
keep rounding down and not towards zero, so instead i had to use int(num1/num2).
