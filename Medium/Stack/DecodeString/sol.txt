this one is tricky; 
you have to add to the stack until you reach a ']'
once you reach a closing bracket, you create a substring
by popping the top of the stack until you reach an opening bracket

then you have to form the number before the opening bracket. so 
while stack and stack[-1].isdigit()
    k = stack.pop()+k

now you concatinate everything and add it back to the stack.
stack.append(int(k)*subsr)

and you continue on.
