the algorithm is in three parts:
- reach at position left
- reverse fromn left to right
- connect everything.

important to use a dummy node. what if the left limit is 1? how would we reverse the list then?
our normal algorithm wouldn't work, since there is nothing before the head.
but using a dummy node prevents edge cases like this, and we can proceed normally

at the end you always return dummy.next and you're good.
you need a previous node, and a current node pointers.

to move on to the next node, save it inside tmp variable.
