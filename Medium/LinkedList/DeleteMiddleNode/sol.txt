two corner cases, if there is no head node, or if there is only a single node in the linked list.
in both cases return head (None).

after that, take the length of the linked list by traversing it, then calculate where the middle
node would be using the floor division operator.

once you reach the node BEFORE the middle node in another traversal, just connect it to the 
node that is after the middle, and return the head.
