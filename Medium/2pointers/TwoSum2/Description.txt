did the brute force algorithm, obviously you get hit by A TIME LIMIT exceeded exception.
as the running time is O(n^2)

->didnt leverage the fact that its an increasing array and is sorted.

The solution is rpetty simple, we know that the array is sorted. so we have one pointer at the beginning and one pointer at the end of the array.
we get the sum of those two elements. if the sum is too big, we need to decrement the right pointer(its pointing to the biggest element)
if the sum is too small, then we increment the left pointer(the one that is pointer to the smallest element.)
This solution is O(n)
