i was on the right track, but i didnt increment my left pointer
properly

-> the thing to notice is this:
for r,bit in enumerate(nums):
    if not bit:
        k-=1

if we reach a 0, then we decrement the our reserve of 1's, which is key
-> with this line: our k CAN ACTUALLY BECOME negative.

for r,bit in enumerate(nums):
    if not bit:
        k-=1
    if k<0:
        k += 1-nums[l]
        l+=1
    res = max(r-l+1,res)

if k becomes negative, then we need to increment our left ptr
if nums[l] is a 0, then we can increment k again. (because we 'put' in the place of that 0 before)
but if nums[l] was not a 0, then we don't add anything to the k.

its a bit difficult to visualize.
