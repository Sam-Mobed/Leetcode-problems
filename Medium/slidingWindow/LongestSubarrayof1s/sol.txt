my solution:
have a variable that keeps track of the index that you 'removed'
you have a left pointer initialized at 0,

res = 0
remove = -1

for r, bit in enumerate(nums):
    if not bit: #we hit a 0
        if remove!=-1: #we dont change the left ptr if 0 is at the first index
            l=remove+1 #we have to move one index from the previous 0 we 'removed'
        remove = r
        res = max(res, r-l)

return len(nums)-1 if remove==-1 else res
