i pretty much solved the problem, had an issue on how to increment the first pointer, but once chatgpt fixed it the rest was good.


Solution:
two mistakes that I made, first, i would use the find method to check for if there is a character that is repeated inside the substring.
i used find bcs i thought to myself what if the character that is repeated is in the middle of the substring. however this case is impossible.
if a character is repeated, it will repeat the very first character of the substring. if the repeated character couldn't even be in the middle
of the substring, it would be excluded.
So instead of using find, you can just increment the ptr1 by one.
as for how to check if the character is inside the substring, you can use a set to check this instead of using the find method. you would use O(n)
memory for this solution, but it would be faster,
