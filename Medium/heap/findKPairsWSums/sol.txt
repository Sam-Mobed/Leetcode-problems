i almost found the solution myself, but got bogged down in a bunch of edge cases, making the code ugly.

got chatgpt to give me the answer.
he imports the heapq data structure. The logic:
Of course! I'd be happy to explain the solution step by step.

The problem asks us to find the k pairs with the smallest sums, where each pair consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array. Both input arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.

To solve this problem, we can use a min heap to efficiently keep track of the pairs with the smallest sums. Here's how the solution works:

1. Initialize a min heap and populate it with the first `min(k, len(nums1))` pairs. Each element in the heap will be a tuple `(sum, index1, index2)`, where `sum` is the sum of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`, and `index1` and `index2` point to the indices of the elements in their respective arrays.

2. While there are more pairs to find (`k > 0`) and the heap is not empty, do the following:
   a. Pop the pair with the smallest sum from the heap.
   b. Add the pair to the result list.
   c. If there are more elements in `nums2` that can form pairs with the current element from `nums1`, add the next pair to the heap (incrementing `index2`).

3. Return the result list containing the k pairs with the smallest sums.

Here's a breakdown of how the code accomplishes these steps:

- In the loop that initializes the heap, we only consider the first `min(k, len(nums1))` pairs. This ensures that we don't try to form pairs with elements that have already been processed or exceed the desired count `k`.

- When popping pairs from the heap, we add the corresponding elements from `nums1` and `nums2` to the result list. We also check if there are more elements in `nums2` that can form pairs with the current element from `nums1` and push those pairs onto the heap.

- The use of a heap ensures that we always select the pair with the smallest sum at each step, allowing us to efficiently find the k smallest pairs.

The solution leverages the fact that the input arrays are sorted, which allows us to explore the pairs with the smallest sums first. By maintaining a min heap, we ensure that the smallest possible sum is always at the top, making it easier to find the next smallest pair and continue until we've found k pairs.
