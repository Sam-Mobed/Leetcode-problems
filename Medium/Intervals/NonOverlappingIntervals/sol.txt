classical intervals problem. the issue i had with my solution was counting the removed intervals. i was keeping track of the
longest interval so far, but this would cuck me if multiple overlapping intervals are of the same size.
also you dont need to keep track of the start value here.

instead of keeping track of the longest interval, you have one value endVal that constantly updates to the smallest right boundary 
of the intervals that you are looking at.
