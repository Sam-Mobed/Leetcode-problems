first you do binary search on the rows, check if the target is between the range of the middle row.
if the target is smaller than the leftmost element of the row, then we check the first half of the rows.
if the target is bigger, than we check the second half.

the mistake i made that i would return row1 incase row1>row2. a habit i got from another binarysearch problem.
when you dont find the target. always return -1 or false or somehting that indicates that it isnt there, unless the problem asks for the index
of where it would have been.
