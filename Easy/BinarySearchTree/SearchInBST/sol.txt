all you have to do is leverage the properties of a BST. run a recursion on the given function.
your base case is that root is none, which means the tree is empty or the node/path where the value
is supposed to be doesnt exist, so we return None.

otherwise, if the value is greater than root.left, search right subtree. otherwise look at the left one.
