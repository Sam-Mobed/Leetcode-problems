you need to have a prev variable set to None. this keeps track of the previous
node.
you also need a 'node' variable that keeps track of the current node that we are looking at

while node isnt none, we store node.next inside of a tmp variable.
we set node.next to prev, and we set prev to node.
tmp = node.next
node.next = prev
prev = node
node = tmp

once we are out of the loop, we return the prev variable, which is now
the head of the linked list. 

can also be done recursively with a helper function:
def reverse(prev, node):
    if not node:
        return prev
    tmp = node.next
    node.next = prev
    prev = node
    node = tmp
    reverse(prev,node)
reverse(None, head)
