fairly straightforward 2 pointers question. just have to be careful with how you increment each ptr.

the solution is a little simple.
it only has a one if statement, if the right pointer is not a 0, (if nums[r])
then we perform a swap and increment the left ptr

in pyhton, non-zero integers are considered true
