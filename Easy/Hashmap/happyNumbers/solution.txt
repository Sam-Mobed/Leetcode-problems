I misunderstood the problem initially. I thought i was supposed to end the loop when the sum hits 1 digit. but that's not always the case. a one digit numer can
go up and then come back down to a sum of 1, which is what we want.

Instead, we should be looking to see if a value repeats itself, which means we have gotten into an infinite loop, and we get out of it (and return False.)

Two improvemnts:
Instead of using a dictionary, use a set. Because you don't need values for the keys anyways.

using a set/dict results in a space complexity of O(n), by using a Linked List cycle, we can use less memory.
