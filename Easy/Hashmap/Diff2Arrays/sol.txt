my solution was to turn both lists into sets.
and then have two loops that iterate over the sets, and if one element is not inside
the other set, then we append to result array's appropriate sublist.

you can't use zip() to iterate over both sets simoultaneously, so you have to iterate
inside two different loops.

the time complexity is O(n+m)
and the space complexity is also O(n+m). not great

the solution:
the exact same thing i did, but the sublist were sets instead, so that 
repeated elements arent stored twice. he would then cast these sets into lists 
and return them inside one list.

i still passed by using lists directly so wtv.
