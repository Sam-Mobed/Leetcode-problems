instead of going through a loop and counting the number of occurences
myself, i used a Counte object and passed the list, which does the same thing.
counter = Counter(arr)

after that, i declared an empty set, and iterated through the values of the counter's keys,
checking if the value that i want to add is already there or not. if it's already there, just return false.
once we get out of the loop, it means that we found no duplicates, so return true.
O(n) time and space complexity.
