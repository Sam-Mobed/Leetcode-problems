Basically the same story as the isomorphic strings problems.
Time complexity is O(n+m)

you can use the zip() function to make your life easier, instead of enumerate(). since we know that both the string and the list have the same length
(before the loop we check if the length is not the same and return false.)

The neetcode solution is far more elegant, so try again later.
