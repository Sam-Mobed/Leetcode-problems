the idea i had to solve it was fine, flatten left subtree, stick it between root and right subtree, and then flatten right subtree, but the executio nwas flawed.
the problem was how to flatten one side, and connect it to the other flattened side.
i tried doing a recursion on the main function (which doesnt return any value), but i didnt recognize that i needed an inner function, that will actually
return the last element inside of a flattened tree, so that everything can be connected.

solution:
look at the code, nothing crazy, but it is something that needs to be well thought through.
time complexity: O(n)
