simple solution, i used two pointers and a boolean variable that would switch between true and false
after each iteration. after the while loop, we check that both pointers have reached the end of their strings.


solution:
few interesting changes inside the solution.
you dont need to have an extra boolean variable that switches between true and false.
if you add one character from word1 on the first line, and then do the same but with word2
on the second line, it is already alternating.

also, you dont need an if statement to check if the pointers have reached the end of the strings;
res.append(word1[i:]). if it has reached the end, then we append empty string which doesnt change anything
if it hasnt, then we append the rest.

appending and updating a string is not an efficient operation, so it's better to have your result
as a list, and then use the join method.
