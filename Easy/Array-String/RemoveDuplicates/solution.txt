Optimal solution:
It would have been better to have had a second pointer instead of using a for loop.

Basically you have a left pointer that keep tracks of where you swap the new value you see, and a right pointer that goes through the list and compares each newElement
with the previous one to see if it can find a new element to insert.

The algorithm is done when the right pointer reaches the end of the list, and the return value is the left pointer (which is on an index).
