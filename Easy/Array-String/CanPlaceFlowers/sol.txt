you just iterate through the array, check for corner case (first and last element in the array)
otherwise just check if the left and right elements are 0's, if they are, plant a flower

straightforward. good time and space complexity, the code itself can most definitely be simpler.

solution:
indeed the code itself is much simpler, the way he handles the edge cases is by adding a 0 to the start
and the end of the array. and we iterates he goes from indices=1 to len(arr)-2 (since he added dummy values)

and in the end he does: return n<=0

although the code is cleaner, performance is worse, as he creates a whole new array, using extra space,
and instead of checking inside the array if n<=0 he does it outside, which means that we will always cover the entire
array even when we dont need to.
