# Repository for LeetCode Problem Solutions

I've created this repository to work on LeetCode problems and keep track of my solutions. It allows me to work on the problems locally without the need for an internet connection, which is useful during periods when I am traveling and don't have proper Internet or in other special circumstances (why I also include the context and test cases for some of the problems). To ensure the solutions are accurate and functional, I pass my solutions to the LeetCode judge once I regain my access to Internet.

In order to organize the repository effectively, I divided it into three sub-directories: easy, medium, and hard.

My current goal is to complete all the problems from the "Top Interview 150" list, which serves as a comprehensive collection of significant interview questions. 

By maintaining this repository, I can monitor my growth and improvements over time, both in terms of problem-solving abilities and the depth of my knowledge in data structures and algorithms.
