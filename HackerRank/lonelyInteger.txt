you could usea dictionary or a set for this problem, but the trick is to use the XOR operator. 
lonely=0
for n in arr:
    lonely ^= n
return lonely

how it works, the duplicate values cancel each other out, and the value of the unique int is carried through to the end.
if you have [1,1,2,3,3,5,5] and start with lonely = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0
0 ^ 2 = 2
2 ^ 3 = 1
1 ^ 3 = 2
2 ^ 5 = 7
7 ^ 5 = 2
