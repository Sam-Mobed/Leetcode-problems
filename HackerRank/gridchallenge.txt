i solved it, probably an inefficient solution, but still.
i iterate over each row, and i turn it into a list of characters.
i sort that list of characters.
grid[i] = [c for c in row]
gird[i].sort

then i iterate over each column, and check if the character in the row above is less than the 
character in the same column but below.
you can compare characters with <,>, and so on.
solution:
def gridChallenge(grid):
    for i,row in enumerate(grid):
        grid[i] = [c for c in row]
        grid[i].sort()
    
    col = 0
    while col<len(grid[0]):
        row=0
        while row+1<len(grid):
            if grid[row][col]>grid[row+1][col]:
                return 'NO'
            row+=1
        
        row=0
        col+=1
    
    return 'YES'
