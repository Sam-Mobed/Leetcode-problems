it's about concentrating on the corner cases and how to deal with them.
first write it down on paper, then do the code.

def timeConversion(s):
    # Write your code here
    if s[-2:] == "AM" and s[:2] == "12":
        military_time = "00" + s[2:-2]
    elif s[-2:] == "PM" and s[:2] == "12":
        military_time = s[:-2]
    elif s[-2:] == "AM":
        military_time = s[:-2]
    else:
        military_time = str(int(s[:2]) + 12) + s[2:-2]
    
    return military_time
