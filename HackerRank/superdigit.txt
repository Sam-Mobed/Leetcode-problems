im continuosly impressed at how fucking dogshit hackerrank phrases its questions.
it doesn't want the super digit of n, but the super digit of n repeated k times????
what the fuck is that supposed to mean.

solution:
def superDigit(n, k):
    
    def recursive(num):
        if len(num)==1:
            return num
        result=0
        for digit in num:
            result+=int(digit)
        return recursive(str(result))
    
    p = recursive(n)*k
    return recursive(p)


so you find the super digit, then you multiply it (if the super digit is 3 and k=2, we want
the super digit of 33)
idk wtv.
