poblem is straightforward. same as the one on leetcode.
however inside the loop, i forgot to check whether the stack is empty,
and we're having a bunch of closing parenthesis added: ))}]

and at the end i forgot to check if the stack is empty. if the stack isnt empty, it means
that some parenthesis were left open and never closed, so you have to return false.
