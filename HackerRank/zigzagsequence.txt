debug the code,it was already written.
-first it didnt calculate the middle index correctly.
-after swapping middle and last element, (last element being n-1), it forgot to decrement the last pointer to n-2
- inside the loop, it would increment both pointers, instead of incrementing one and decrementing the other.
